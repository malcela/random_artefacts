# Random Artefacts


Random Artefacts is inspired by the antipoetry of Nicanor Parra. He described the antipoetry process of making “as easy as taking a diary, cutting up a large number of words, putting them in a bag, shaking it, and taking them out one by one by joining them with a conector”. Taking his process as an inspiration, I developed a software that takes a curated number of my Instagram advertising algorithm and I combine them randomly with Parras Artefacts. In Parra’s work, an Artefact is a poetic piece of one or two sentences, summarised and loaded to the maximum, usually accompanied with a visual object. Within this idea in mind, I seek to explore visual and text random associations and find new semantics, as an updated form of Parras methodology of creation.

## Installation and Software
The process of creating the installation consisted first of all in collecting phrases used by Parra in his Artefacts or in his visual artwork. Around 100 phrases were collected and translated from into English. In parallel, about 200 images from different advertisements were collected from instagram. This process was not random, but rather there was a curatorial process in order to select the most interesting and/or absurd, funny images.

The software works as follows:

From the image archive, the software selects an image randomly. This selection changes after three seconds, and after one second of searching, a new image appears on the screen.
At the same time, the software searches for one of Parra’s phrases and randomly matches the image pulled from Instagram’s algorithm, along with Parra’s phrase, or the “Artefact”.
The result is a combination of image and words that create new meanings in the mind of the observer.
